# A mostly Chat-GPT generated chat bot.

This was built using create-react-app.
Chat GPT wrote the server and client chat UI.  
I adjusted a few styles manually to get it to use the whole browser.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

Load the folder in VS Code

Includes a server under server folder:

To run the node socket.io server:
  cd server
  node server.js

In root folder:
  npm start
  A browser will load at port 3000.

  Open a second instance in the browser.

  Type a message and see that it appears in both browsers.
